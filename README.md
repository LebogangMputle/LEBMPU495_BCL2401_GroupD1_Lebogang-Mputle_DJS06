# DJS06: Higher Order Functions

## Objective:

1. The essence of using these higher-order functions is to encourage a declarative approach to programming: you define what you want to achieve (e.g., filter a list, transform data) without having to specify how to perform the operations step-by-step (as you would with imperative loops like for or while).
